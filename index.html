      <h3>Our Shared Learning Index</h3>
      <p>
        Welcome to Critical Fields, a decentralized, peer-to-peer platform for early-career thinkers engaged in interdisciplinary critical studies. Our goal is to make the intellectual ecosystems of critical scholarship more visible, accessible, and open-source.
      </p>
      <p>
        We gather blogs, reading lists, events, calls for submissions, and networks across the disciplines of economics, anthropology, cultural studies, history and politics. We also spotlight work that addresses inequality, post-coloniality, and the specific philosophical and pragmatic questions facing our generation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Built by and for people under 25, Critical Fields platforms independent contributions to our shared learning index.
